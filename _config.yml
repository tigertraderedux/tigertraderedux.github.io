# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: TigerTrade Redux

  TigerTrade is a platform that is widely-used (mostly by graduate students) for buying and
  selling goods. It last saw active development by Rodrigo Menezes â€˜13, and is aging by the
  day. The goal of our project is to revamp TigerApps by reimplementing it on a modern
  stack with new features that would make it sufficiently appealing for undergraduates
  to use.
